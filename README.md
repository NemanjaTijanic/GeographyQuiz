# Geography Quiz
**Introduction**

This is a simple console app made with C programming language. It is a quiz in serbian based around capital cities of countries around the world that I made with the sole purpose of utilizing as much knowledge gained from a university course as possible.

## Specifics

The aim of this project is to provide a mini-game that allows the user to test and expand their knowledge about the capitals of countries around the world.

Upon launching the program, the user enters their username and selects one of four categories (world capitals, only Europe, only Asia, only Africa). After that, they choose whether they want to answer 10, 20, or 30 questions. Once they have answered all the questions, the user is shown how many correct answers they provided, as well as the username and score of the person who achieved the highest score in that category.

## Installation

Visual Studio version 2019 or higher is required (64-bit).

- Download GeographyQuiz folder and SLN file.
- Open the project using Visual Studio.
- Build and run the app.
